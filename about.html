<p class="p">Hey, my name is Anthony Meza Sandí.<br>
I’m interested in cybersecurity and AI <br>
I’m currently learning networks and operating systems<br>
Nothing special, i study in CTP de Santa Ana (approximate location: Lindora - Terrazas) -Fucking school-<br>
I do python mainly, and sometimes web dev. (HTML, CSS)<br>
I will update later this shit called ams.tech jajaj<br>
I would like to dedicate myself to AI and cibersecurity, it´s amazing all you can do it with some lines of code.<br>
You can find me on the deep web as Tech47 (World Market and others) be carefully in this sites (VM + VPN) <a href="onions.html">Onion Links</a><br>
Maybe later make this site more intersting (Web development is boring for me, i will use this like repository and document my projects )
